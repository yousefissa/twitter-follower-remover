# Twitter Follower Remover

This script is very simple. It removes all of your twitter followers. This is good if you're trying to restart your account, clean-out followers, etc. It does just one thing - removes all your followers by blocking and unblocking them. This kills the friendship and allows them to refollow you.


### Prerequisites 

Valid twitter tokens. This is super easy to set up on [http://twitter.com/apps](twitter.com/apps)


### Installing

Simply run `npm install` to install the required dependencies. The comments make this script super easy to set up and use. Simply change the remove.js file and fill in with your Twitter tokens and screen name. 


### Deployment

Use `npm install` to install required dependencies. Then run `npm start` to start this script and begin losing followers!
